###
This is an example interactive dashboard for exploring mixed tabular data (i.e. continuous and categorical variables). Data can be filtered on a continuous feature (e.g. weight, GPA, etc.) and visualized in real-time for quickly identifying statistically meaningful relationships across multiple variables. 

This dashboard was built using R Shiny, ggplot, tidyverse, flexdashboard, and plotly.

Data plotted are fictional and for demonstration purposes only.
